# Grandma's TV

A simple project to make navigating to various streaming services simple and easy for my grandma. This site is loaded directly onto a microprocessor behind their TV (it's secretly just a website, don't tell her) and is opened automatically when they turn their TV on.

As of 1.1.0, tv.brannan.cloud now has a ChatGPT-powered chat bot that enables grandma to type the name of a show, and if it's a valid show on Netflix or Youtube, have the option to instantly navigate to the show on the website.
